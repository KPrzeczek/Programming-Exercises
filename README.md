# Programming Tests
Just some mini coding 'tests' I do to test something out instead of making it into a fully fledged thing and then realize that it is complete wack

## ECS
Actually, more like a component architecture. The system part was merged with the components so its more like Entity Component..s. I did this for 2 reasons:  
* Because C# is more object-oriented rather than object oriented
* The actual reason, I have no idea how to actually program and this was just easier.
