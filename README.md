# Programming Tests
Just some mini coding 'tests' I do to test something out instead of making it into a fully fledged thing and then realize that it is complete wack

## Particle Lines
Just some fun with MonoGame. All it is is just some balls that fly around the screen and lines between them connect with an opacity proportional to the distance between the two FloatingCircles.

## ECS
Actually, more like a component architecture. The system part was merged with the components so its more like Entity Component..s. I did this for 2 reasons:  
* Because C# is more object-oriented rather than data-oriented
* The actual reason, I have no idea how to actually program and this was just easier.

## LearnOpenGL
Self explanitory, followed the amazing LearnOpenGL tutorials and made a basic 3D renderer where you can fly around with a camera.
